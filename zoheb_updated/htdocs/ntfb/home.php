What We Do
Founded in 1982, the North Texas Food Bank (NTFB) is a Dallas nonprofit hunger relief organization that distributes donated, purchased and prepared foods through a network of more than 340 Food Assistance Partners in 13 counties. As a member of Feeding America, we support the nutritional needs of children, families and seniors through education, advocacy and strategic partnerships.

We strive to be the best nonprofit. Including access provided through SNAP application services, NTFB provides access to nearly 130,000 nutritious meals every day. ReThink Hunger is our three-year initiative to provide healthier food, develop new ways to extend our reach and improve the lives of those we serve.

Our Mission
NTFB passionately pursues a hunger-free community.

Our Five Core Values
1. Do what needs to be done.
2. Do what is right with urgency.
3. Steward and leverage resources with integrity in an authentic transparent way.
4. Respect diversity of individuals, thoughts and viewpoints.
5. Celebrate passion for our world and the people who live in it.

Our Impact
Including access provided through SNAP application services, we provided 47 million nutritious meals last year. We have a network of more than 340 Food Assistance Partners and provide access to food at more than 1,100 feeding locations.

Our Effectiveness
Every dollar donated to NTFB provides three meals to hungry North Texans, and out of every dollar, 94 cents goes directly to hunger relief programs.</p>
